# SimuATM (2020)

SimuATM is a Python-based software designed and developed to simulate the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM). The project includes a customer console for user interaction, an envelope deposit slot, a cash dispenser supporting 50 LE denominations, and a printer for generating receipts.

## Features

- **Customer Console:** SimuATM provides a user-friendly interface for customers to interact with the simulated ATM. Users can perform various banking transactions seamlessly.

- **Envelope Deposit Slot:** The project includes a simulated envelope deposit slot, allowing users to make deposits securely.

- **Cash Dispenser:** SimuATM features a cash dispenser that supports 50 LE denominations. The dispenser is designed to efficiently handle cash transactions.

- **Printer for Receipts:** The ATM simulation incorporates a printer functionality to generate receipts for transactions, ensuring a record of user activities.

## Functionality

The project encompasses the following key functionalities:

- **Card Validation:** SimuATM implements robust card validation mechanisms to ensure secure access to the ATM's features.

- **ATM Constraints:** Various constraints are in place to emulate real-world ATM limitations and enhance the simulation's authenticity.

- **Cash Dispensing Algorithms:** Advanced algorithms are integrated to govern the cash dispensing process, providing a realistic and secure user experience.
